6. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
7. Naive Bayes


## How Each Algorithm Works

### Linear Regression
Linear regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

### Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a statistical method for analyzing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome.

### Decision Trees
Decision trees recursively split the data into subsets based on the most significant attribute at each step.

### Random Forests
Random forests build multiple decision trees and merge them together to get a more accurate and stable prediction.

### Support Vector Machines (SVM)
SVM finds the hyperplane that best separates different classes in the feature space.

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
KNN classifies objects based on the majority class of their k-nearest neighbors in the feature space.

### Naive Bayes
Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions between the features.

### Neural Networks
Neural networks are a set of algorithms, modeled loosely after the human brain, that are designed to recognize patterns.

## Choosing the Right Algorithm
- **Linear Regression**: When the relationship between dependent and independent variables is linear.
- **Logistic Regression**: For binary classification problems.
- **Decision Trees & Random Forests**: For both classification and regression problems, especially when interpretability is important.
- **SVM**: For classification tasks with complex decision boundaries.
- **KNN**: When there is no clear separation in the feature space or for small to medium-sized datasets.
- **Naive Bayes**: For text classification and when feature independence assumption holds.
- **Neural Networks**: For complex patterns and large datasets.
